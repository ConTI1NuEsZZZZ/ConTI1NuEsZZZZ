### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mark â€” AI Automation Enthusiast & Prompt Engineer

I'm building my way from zero to mastery in AI-powered automation, prompt engineering, and product development using Python + OpenAI.

ðŸ”§ Currently learning:  
- GPT-4 APIs, LangChain, Streamlit  
- Python scripting for real-world automation  
- Building micro-products with AI (bots, assistants, digital tools)

ðŸŽ¯ My goals:  
- Help businesses save time with GPT automation  
- Build smart AI tools people actually want  
- Earn my freedom by creating real value through code

ðŸ§  I believe in deep work, no shortcuts, and learning until it burns into my brain.
